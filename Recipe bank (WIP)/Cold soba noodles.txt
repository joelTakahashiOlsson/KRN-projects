Preparation

Noodles

Ready a couple of large tinpans with ice.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt it with care. Cook noodles until tender, about three minutes. Monitor continuously!
Drain the pot and rinse the noodles under cold water. Transfer the noodles to the tinpans. Store the noodles in the tinpans, and change water or add ice if needed to keep the noodles cold. 
Prepare the gluten-free spaghetti or noodles separately in a similar manner.

Sauce

Prepare vegetable stock in a large stockpot, bring to a boil. 
For the soy-free variant, pour over one portion to a small stockpot and add mirin (about 1 msk) to taste. For the regular variant: continue in the large stockpot, lower the heat and add soy sauce and mirin.
Scallions
Wash and chop the scallions finely.

If sesame seeds are going to be used, toast them in a frying pan for added taste.

Serve the noodles and the sauce separately. Garnish the noodles with scallions, horseradish and optional sesame seeds.
